# Cosmobots Challenge
A simple project that uses Node.js to insert bots into a postgres database

Usage
-----

1. `docker-compose up`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`

Important!!
---------

If you need to stop the postgres container, you have to run
`docker-compose down -v` to remove the volumes as well.
This way, you can get the initial data for the 'groups' table
